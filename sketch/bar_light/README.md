# Bar Light  
This is a line of LEDs that can be used for lighting, decoration, and displaying the temperature.  

## Hardware  
The hardware consists of:  
* [Uno R3 Controller Board](https://www.amazon.com/ELEGOO-Board-ATmega328P-ATMEGA16U2-Compliant/dp/B01EWOE0UU)
* [WS2811 Digital RGB LEDs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AG923GI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* 5 volts, 3 amps power supply
* IR remote controller
* IR receiver module
* 10k ohm resistor
* Thermistor
* 13 male-to-male Dupont wires
* 170-point mini breadboard
* Yardstick
* Plastic Arduino case

The WS2811 LEDs are attached in a line to the yardstick.  

### Wiring  
The electrical components are connected using a breadboard, but for a more permanent and durable project, they could be directly soldered together.
