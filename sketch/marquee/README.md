# Marquee  
This marquee is made of a grid of WS2811 LEDS and displays a scrolling message.  

## Hardware  
The hardware consists of:  
+ [Uno R3 Controller Board](https://www.amazon.com/ELEGOO-Board-ATmega328P-ATMEGA16U2-Compliant/dp/B01EWOE0UU)
+ [WS2811 Digital RGB LEDs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AG923GI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
+ 5 Volts 3Amps power supply
+ IR remote controller
+ IR receiver module
+ 10k ohm resistor
+ Thermistor
+ 13 Male-to-male dupont wires
+ 170-point mini breadboard
+ Cardboard box
+ Plastic arduino code  

The LEDs are arranged in a grid pattern in the cardboard box.  Below, there is a diagram showing how the electrical components are connected.  

### Wiring   
The electrical components are connected using a breadboard, but for a more permanent and durable project, they could be directly soldered together.
