# Gridlight  
This is a grid of LEDs that can be used for lighting, decoration, and telling the temperature.  

## Hardware  
The hardware consists of:  
* [Uno R3 Controller Board](https://www.amazon.com/ELEGOO-Board-ATmega328P-ATMEGA16U2-Compliant/dp/B01EWOE0UU)
* [WS2811 Digital RGB LEDs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AG923GI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* 5 Volts 3Amps power supply
* IR remote controller
* IR receiver module
* 10k ohm resistor
* Thermistor
* 13 Male-to-male dupont wires
* 170-point mini breadboard
* Cardboard box
* Plastic arduino code

The LEDs are arranged in a grid pattern in the cardboard box. Below, there is a diagram showing how the electrical components are connected.  

### Wiring  
The electrical components are connected using a breadboard, but for a more permanent and durable project, they could be directly soldered together.
