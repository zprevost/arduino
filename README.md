# Arduino
This repository holds my Arduino projects.

## [Alarm](https://github.com/zprevost/arduino/blob/master/sketch/alarm)
I created an Arduino alarm that plays music if someone gets too close to it. To reduce false detections, the alarm must detect a presence for at lease half a second before it triggers.  
  
## [Bar Light](https://github.com/zprevost/arduino/tree/master/sketch/bar_light)  
I created a line of LEDs that can be used for lighting, decoration, and displaying the temperature.  
  
## [Gridlight](https://github.com/zprevost/arduino/tree/master/sketch/gridlight_5x10)  
I created a grid of LEDs that can be used for lighting, decoration, and displaying the temperature.  
  
## [Marquee](https://github.com/zprevost/arduino/tree/master/sketch/marquee)
I used the gridlight to create a marquee that displays a scrolling message.  
  
## [Robot Car](https://github.com/zprevost/arduino/tree/master/sketch/robot_car)
I have an Arduino-controlled robot car and am modifying its code.
